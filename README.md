# Luminance

**Luminance** is a comprehensive Formula 1 stats and information tracker designed to help users manage, analyze, and visualize F1 data. Whether you're a dedicated fan or a data enthusiast, Luminance offers intuitive tools for the job.

## Features
 - Individual "leaf" pages (any page referencing a specific driver, team, or track) can be favorited by toggling the heart in the header on the right of the page title.
   - Favorited pages are accessible from the "Favorites" tab. Going through the title cards on either the favorites page or the original tab will redirect to the same leaf reference, making changes consistent.
 - Edits can be made to any of the relevant information on each leaf node via \<mu-form> using the "Edit" button appearing on that page's footer. 
 - Signing up as a new user should be supported, and if an existing username is attempted the page should give a helpfull error tip.
   - If signing up for whatever reason isn't working, please email me via the contact below and feel free to use this demo account for the time being: </br>
   Username: "testUser" </br>
   Password: "testPassword"
 - Lightmode is off by default, but can be toggled via the slider next to the flashbang in the top right of the page above the signout button.
 - The title text in the header serves as an innate "Home" button, with the browser "←" and "→" button serving as innate undo and redo options for navigation.

## Note
For whatever reason, the database sometimes decides it just wants to take 3-5 business days to send the data for any given page (likely from the fact that this is all built on a free plan lol). I have yet to see a case where the page never loads, but if something starts taking too long (or you're feeling impatient like me) I've found reloading the page to send another request can tend to speed things up.
